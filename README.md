# SnakesAndLadders-Game Low-level-Design
  
# Requirements
 Before jump into the design, we will figure out required entities. The first entity that came into our mind is Game. The game will consist of Players, Board & Dice.While considering the board we have Ladders and Snake. 
 For Snake we have to take head and tail.
       head - start position 
       tail - lower position  Same for the Ladder too.
